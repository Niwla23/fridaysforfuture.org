This repository is used to develop and maintain the international website of FridaysForFuture, a grassroots movement urging politicians and media to treat the climate crisis as a serious threat.

Branch explanations:
- The master branch is meant to represent the current stable version which is live.
- The hotfix branch is meant for quick bug fixes on the stable version.
- The develop branch is where any new development occurs.

To contribute, select an issue from our issue board to work on. For all issues which are not urgent bugs, create a new branch based on develop and work on the issue there. Commit every so often and once you are done with the issue and you feel your code is ready to go live, create a pull request with your code. This code will then be checked on and hopefully accepted and merged into the project by one of the repository admins.
